Assignment #3: Due March 2.

Remember that the homework is due by midnight on the due date. You must 
turn in a soft copy via email to TA. Your submission should have a cover page 
and one or more summary pages where you provide for each problem the
answer. You should not submit the data you use if the data is too
large. You must submit your code.

1. Build a baseline statistical tagger.

(i) [10 points] Use the assignment#2's hash of hashes to train a
baseline lexicalized statistical tagger on the entire BROWN corpus.

(ii) [20 points] Use the baseline lexicalized statistical tagger to tag 
all the words in the SnapshotBROWN.pos.all.txt file. Evaluate and report the
performance of this baseline tagger on the Snapshot file.

(iii) [20 points] add few rules to handle unknown words for the tagger
   in (ii). The rules can be morphological, contextual, or of other
   nature. Use 25 new sentences to evaluate this tagger (the (ii) tagger +
   unknown word rules). You can pick 25 sentences from a news article
   from the web and report the performance on those.

NOTE: You should only consider the 45 proper tags from Penn Treebank
tagset (available in the slides). You should disregard tags such as
-NONE-, etc.
